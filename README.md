TO DO-
1. first and foremost make a list of all the MAJOR functions to be created individually - describing 1.input 2.output such that the
framework can be created and each guy creates his functions acc to the inputs or outputs expected in acc with other functions
(pref on call)

2. Add everything on Github whenever done- (very easy just just go to pull request or if you are sure check upload directly your code)
For changes made- (in preview changes) removed code appears in red added code appears in green looks very cool very convenient
